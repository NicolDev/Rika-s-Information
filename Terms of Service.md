RIKA TERMS OF SERVICE,
LAST UPDATE: 3 MAY 2022

### What’s covered in these terms

## We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Rika services, and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect the way Rika works, the laws that apply to our bot, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Rika’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

    1.What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services

    2.What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
    
# What You Can Expect From Us
Rika is not only a Discord bot, it is secure, trustful, user-friendly and more. We will **NOT** share your information. We will only keep it in our database for future uses. If you feel uncomfortable, kindly join [support server](https://discord.gg/W6FfCHPNGq) and request the head of bot developer, Nicole, to delete it. Don't worry, we will **NOT** collect sensitive information from you, or any users. We will collect user id who created the sourcebin url, and also server id so we can know which server the user created from. Beside that, we also record every sourcebin url that created to our database.

# What We Expect From You
By using our bot, you will need to agree to our rules:
```
1.Agree to let Rika collect some of my information, such as my Discord user id and my Discord server id.

2.Agree to let Rika logs any other information for the upcoming updates.

3.Agree to not abuse bugs.
```
